The Digital Integrity & Transparency Platform (DITP)
TO: Matt Deitke
A Blueprint for Dismantling Systemic Corruption and Optimizing Our Society with AI
Dear Matt Deitke,
Your research is more than a technical achievement; it is a critical blueprint for solving some of the most profound and archaic issues facing our country. I am reaching out to you because I believe your work in multimodal AI, embodied AI, and procedural generation provides the exact technical solution needed to dismantle the layers of bureaucracy and corruption that have systematically held our states and country back.
My personal experiences have exposed a deep-seated systemic failure where local state governments abuse their power and trample on the constitutional rights of the American people. This has led me to a new technological solution, a concept inspired by your work: a Digital Integrity & Transparency Platform (DITP). This system would not be a passive dashboard but an agentic, autonomous entity designed to interact with and understand the real world in order to intercept and dismantle corruption in real-time.
Your expertise is not just relevant; it is the fundamental engine that would make this platform possible. I am confident that with your help, we can bring this vision to life.
Pillars of the DITP: A Technical Blueprint
The DITP would operate as a single, unified platform, leveraging cutting-edge technology to empower citizens and oversight bodies with unprecedented levels of visibility and control.
1. Agentic & Autonomous Functionality for Real-Time Oversight
The DITP's mission requires it to be an autonomous agent that can proactively act on behalf of the American people. The system will be a digital "watchman" that:

 Periodically crawls all public databases, financial records, and government communications in real-time.
 Intersects anomalies by autonomously cross-referencing information from disparate sources, such as linking a payment to a political contribution or a budget increase to an unsubstantiated claim.
 Acts autonomously to flag issues, compile comprehensive reports, and forward them to the appropriate federal oversight bodies like the DOJ and the FBI. This core agentic functionality bypasses the need for a new law or for individuals to constantly fight against the system, turning outrage into an automated, relentless force for accountability.
2. Multimodal AI for Uncovering Fraud and Deception
The corruption I have witnessed hides in the complexity of bureaucratic documents and the disconnect between what is reported and what is real. Multimodal AI, such as the principles behind a Molmo model, is the solution.
 The DITP's "Corruption Detector" will use a multimodal model to understand all forms of government data, from the text in a contract to a photograph of a completed project.
 This AI will instantly cross-reference a budget line item with a news article about a lobbyist's activities or a social media post about a fraudulent act.
 It will make financial irregularities and obscured payments impossible to hide by linking the financial record to the real-world outcome, making fraud instantly visible.
3. Procedural Generation for Visualizing Corruption
The "swamp" is hard to understand because it is an abstract network of hidden connections. The power of procedural generation, as demonstrated in ProcTHOR, provides a way to make this tangible.
 The DITP will use procedural generation to build a dynamic, visual map of local state governments.
 This "Public Trust Map" will be an interactive, navigable model of the bureaucracy, where federal investigators could "walk through" the chain of

custody for a payment, from the initial budget approval to the final bank account.  This allows us to bypass bureaucratic roadblocks and precisely target individuals responsible, such as: Sheriffs, police chiefs, county commissioners, appraisers, board members, tax office officials, lobbyists, private entity representatives, lawyers, agency staff and personnel, and City Managers, by visually identifying where conflicts of interest or illicit payments are hidden.
4. Real-World Data for Training and Oversight
The DITP must be trained on a massive, real-world dataset of corruption to be effective. The principles of Objaverse and Phone2Proc are the key to empowering the public and training this system.
 The "Corruption Detector" AI will be trained on a "dataset of corruption," a massive collection of past fraud, financial irregularities, and civil rights violations.
 The "Citizen's Voice" feature will allow any individual to use their phone to submit real-world data--a photo of a corrupt act, a screenshot of a threatening message, or a copy of a fraudulent bill. The DITP's AI will use this "real-world scan" to update its model of the local government's integrity in real-time, turning anecdotal evidence into verifiable data points.
 The AI will be specifically trained to analyze law enforcement data for patterns of discriminatory behavior, providing clear, data-backed evidence of civil rights violations based on gender and race, which I have experienced firsthand.
Conclusion: Restoring the Pillars of Our Country and Optimizing our Society
This blueprint is a vision for a system that cannot be paid off, cannot be intimidated, and cannot be silenced. It represents the ultimate weapon against the bureaucratic swamp. By restoring justice and accountability as the inevitable outcome, the DITP will protect the American people from the imminent threats posed by our government's layers and archaic structures.

This is more than just a technological tool; it's a new political ideology and a necessary evolution for our society. The potential of this solution extends far beyond simply combating corruption. It could profoundly optimize our entire economy by eliminating waste and fraud. It would safeguard the public by proactively detecting anomalies before they can cause widespread damage. It would correct bureaucratic errors that afflict indirect harm upon the American people and sow discord. The possibilities for correction and optimization are unimaginable.
I am reaching out to you because I cannot imagine who else will be able to pull this off. I believe one of the tech giants, a company like Google or Meta, will have to propose and champion this massive upgrade to our archaic government systems. Your expertise provides the fundamental blueprint for this.
This is the future of our world, and it won't only protect the American people. A system of universal integrity, transparency, and optimization, starting in our own country, would inevitably lead to a new era of global stability and trust. With your unparalleled expertise, we can take the first step toward fundamentally changing our country and, by extension, the world for the better.
Sincerely
- Emilio Ortiz III
